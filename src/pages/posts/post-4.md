Day two of following the [tutorial](https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/5-astro-api/1/) now and I'm starting to really come around to Astro! 

It's a pretty fun framework, the layouts make designing the pages easy and the components make me feel like I'm still programming and not just writing blog posts ;) 

## glob, glob
Astro Globs let you access your files and the cool part is that they import the frontmatter too! This means that you can pull information such as the title (as long as your files are setup correctly) and display it dynamically.
